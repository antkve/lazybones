=== PROBLEM 1 ===

=== TRIAL 1 ===

FINAL GOAL:
Create a binary calculator program in python.

CURRENT TASK:
Write arithmetic functions: Write some python functions for doing arithmetic on binary strings.

CURRENT SUBTASKS:
- Write test for BinaryString class
- Write test for add_two_numbers
- Write test for subtract_two_numbers
- Write test for multiply_two_numbers
- Run the tests

RECENT ACTIONS:
- I wrote some comments in main.py
- I wrote the following functions/classes in test_binary_arithmetic.py: test_binary_string(a), test_add_two_numbers(a, b)
- I wrote the following functions/classes in logging.py: log(message), log_error(message), log_warning(message), log_success(message)
- I ran the command 'python main.py' and got the following output: "Hello world!"
- I ran the command 'pip install dotenv' and got the following output: "Successfully installed dotenv-0.19.0"

RELEVANT LONG-TERM MEMORIES:
- I wrote the following functions/classes in binary_arithmetic.py: BinaryString(str) add_two_numbers(a, b), subtract_two_numbers(a, b), multiply_two_numbers(a, b)
- I ran the following command: pip install unittest
- I installed python and unittest

MESSAGE:
Now you should write a test for the binary add_two_numbers function, which you've written in binary_arithmetic.py. The test should include at least 5 test cases,
and should be in a file called test_binary_arithmetic.py. It should use the unittest module.

It looks like you're just starting out with this project. Before you jump into writing the code, you should take some time to plan out exactly what classes and functions you'll need, and how they'll interact with each other. This will help you stay organized and make sure you don't miss anything. Once you have a plan, you can start writing the code for the Ray and Raycaster classes.

- Create the "raytracer" folder
- Create the "src" folder
- Create the "include" folder
- Create the "lib" folder
- Create the "test" folder
- Create the "data" folder

SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTIONS:
You should create the "raytracer" folder, then create the "src", "include", "lib", "test" and "data" folders inside it. You can do this by using the terminal commands "mkdir raytracer" and "mkdir raytracer/src raytracer/include raytracer/lib raytracer/test raytracer/data".

=== PROBLEM 1 ===

=== TRIAL 1 ===

FINAL GOAL:
Create a binary calculator program in python.

CURRENT TASK:
Write arithmetic functions: Write some python functions for doing arithmetic on binary strings.

CURRENT SUBTASKS:
- Write test for BinaryString class
- Write test for add_two_numbers
- Write test for subtract_two_numbers
- Write test for multiply_two_numbers
- Run the tests

RECENT ACTIONS:
- I wrote some comments in main.py
- I wrote the following functions/classes in test_binary_arithmetic.py: test_binary_string(a), test_add_two_numbers(a, b)
- I wrote the following functions/classes in logging.py: log(message), log_error(message), log_warning(message), log_success(message)
- I ran the command 'python main.py' and got the following output: "Hello world!"
- I ran the command 'pip install dotenv' and got the following output: "Successfully installed dotenv-0.19.0"

RELEVANT LONG-TERM MEMORIES:
- I wrote the following functions/classes in binary_arithmetic.py: BinaryString(str) add_two_numbers(a, b), subtract_two_numbers(a, b), multiply_two_numbers(a, b)
- I ran the following command: pip install unittest
- I installed python and unittest

MESSAGE:
Now you should write a test for the binary add_two_numbers function, which you've written in binary_arithmetic.py. The test should include at least 5 test cases,
and should be in a file called test_binary_arithmetic.py. It should use the unittest module.

My employee has asked me the following question:
What command should I use to create a source file?

After I gave him the following goal and instructions:
"C: Now you should create two source files called "raytracer.cpp" and "raytracer.h" in the "Raytracing_Library" folder. You can do this by running the commands 'touch raytracer.cpp' and 'touch raytracer.h' in the "Raytracing_Library" folder."

Here is what I remember:
I created a folder called "Raytracing_Library" using the command 'mkdir Raytracing_Library'. I navigated to the Raytracing_Library folder using the command 'cd'. I attempted to create a source file using the command 'touch raytracer.cpp', but this command was not recognized. None of the memories provided answer the question directly, so additional information is needed in order to answer it.

Here is what I know about each part of my code:
None. It is not necessary to have any code to answer the question. The question can be answered simply by using the command "touch [filename.extension]", where [filename.extension] is the name and file extension of the source file you want to create.

Here is my answer:

===================================================================================================
------------------------ CONTEXT RETURNED FROM SUPERVISOR/ADVISOR AGENT --------------------------
The command you should use to create a source file is 'touch [filename.extension]', where [filename.extension] is the name and file extension of the source file you want to create.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I asked the supervisor the question 'What command should I use to create a source file?' and got the following reply: The command you should use to create a source file is 'touch [filename.extension]', where [filename.extension] is the name and file extension of the source file you want to create.

FINAL GOAL:
Write a 2D raytracing library in C++ for use in 2D platformers, complete with shadows, reflections and refractions

COMPLETE TASK LIST:
Task 1. Create a folder:  Create a folder in the current directory called "Raytracing_Library".
Task 2. Create Source files:  Create two source files called "raytracer.cpp" and "raytracer.h" in the "Raytracing_Library" folder. (Current task)
Task 3. Write Code:  Write the basic code for the raytracing library in the files, including a header file, class declarations and a constructor.
Task 4. Write Tests:  Write a set of unit tests for the raytracing library.
Task 5. Compile and Run:  Compile and run the code to make sure it works as expected.
Task 6. Add Shadows:  Add code to implement shadows in the raytracer.
Task 7. Add Reflections:  Add code to implement reflections in the raytracer.
Task 8. Add Refractions:  Add code to implement refractions in the raytracer

CURRENT SUBTASK LIST:
- Create a source file called "raytracer.cpp" in the "Raytracing_Library" folder
- Create a header file called "raytracer.h" in the "Raytracing_Library" folder

SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTIONS:
Now you should create two source files called "raytracer.cpp" and "raytracer.h" in the "Raytracing_Library" folder. You can do this by running the commands 'touch raytracer.cpp' and 'touch raytracer.h' in the "Raytracing_Library" folder.

ACTION EXECUTION SYNTAX:
"""
>THOUGHTS:
thoughts about the last output and reasoning behind your current action
>ACTION:
ACTION_NAME:
arg1
[arg2]
>ENDACTION
"""

After each action, wait for the output. After each output, give your next thoughts and action.
Ask the Supervisor any questions you have about the codebase or what has been done in the project so far.
You should complete your subtasks in the order they are given, and make sure to run MARK_TASK_COMPLETE before you move onto the next task.

OUTPUT:
touch : The term 'touch' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling 
of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

>THOUGHTS:

It looks like the command 'touch' is not recognized. I should ask my supervisor for help.
>ACTION:
ASK_SUPERVISOR:
What command should I use to create a source file?
>ENDACTION
OUTPUT:
The command you should use to create a source file is 'touch [filename.extension]', where [filename.extension] is the name and file extension of the source file you want to create.
